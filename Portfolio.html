                            <h3>Car racing Simulator</h3>
                            <p>
                                I have developed a car racing simulator within processing, 
                                where it is counted how many times each car wins a race, this number is displayed ontop of the veichle, 
                                The program also takes cars drawing in the race into consideration. 
                                This is based of the use of random vairiables for movement for unpredictability.

                                I have developed this very website to display information about myself for employers, 
                                information such as my education, my skills, my work experience, 
                                a portfolio of the projects that I have completed, 
                                And a way to contact me through the use of either a form, email, or social medias such as GitHub and LinkedIn.

                            <p>
                                I have developed a small ball catching game within processing, 
                                where the user must control the panel at the bottom of the screen to catch as many balls as they possibly can, 
                                this number is then displayed at the top of the screen. 
                                It also includes the functionality to add any number of balls to be caught at once.
